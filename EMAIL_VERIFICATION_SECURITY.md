# Email Verification Security Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive email verification security system implemented in the New Market application to prevent unauthorized access and ensure user email authenticity.

## Overview

The application now enforces **mandatory email verification** for all users who register with credentials (email/password). Users cannot sign in until they verify their email address, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring email authenticity.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. NextAuth Credentials Provider Security

**Location:** `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`

The credentials provider now includes email verification checks:

```typescript
// Check if email is verified
if (!user.emailVerified) {
  // Throw a specific error for unverified email
  throw new Error("EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED");
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Prevents sign-in with unverified accounts
- Throws specific error for proper handling
- Maintains authentication flow integrity

### 2. Sign-In Page Error Handling

**Location:** `app/auth/sign-in/page.tsx`

The sign-in form now handles email verification errors:

```typescript
if (result.error === "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED") {
  // Redirect to verify email page with the email
  router.push(`/auth/verify-email?email=${encodeURIComponent(data.email)}`);
  return;
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Graceful handling of unverified accounts
- Automatic redirection to verification page
- Preserves user email for easy verification

### 3. Middleware Protection

**Location:** `middleware.ts`

Existing middleware already protects routes requiring email verification:

```typescript
// Check email verification for routes that require it
if (token && emailVerificationRequiredRoutes.some((route) => pathname.startsWith(route))) {
  if (!token.emailVerified) {
    // Redirect to email verification page
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/auth/verify-email", req.url));
  }
}
```

**Protected Routes:**
- `/profile`
- `/admin`
- `/api/user`
- `/api/admin`

### 4. Database Schema Security

**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

The User model includes comprehensive email verification fields:

```prisma
model User {
  emailVerified            DateTime?
  emailVerificationToken   String?
  emailVerificationExpires DateTime?
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Security Features:**
- `emailVerified`: Timestamp when email was verified
- `emailVerificationToken`: Hashed verification token
- `emailVerificationExpires`: Token expiration (24 hours)

### 5. Token Security

**Location:** `lib/auth/email-verification.ts`

Secure token generation and validation:

```typescript
// Generate cryptographically secure token
export function generateEmailVerificationToken(): string {
  return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
}

// Hash token using SHA-256
export function hashEmailVerificationToken(token: string): string {
  return crypto.createHash("sha256").update(token).digest("hex");
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- Cryptographically secure random tokens
- SHA-256 hashing for database storage
- 24-hour token expiration
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

## Authentication Flow Security

### Registration Flow
1. User registers with email/password
2. Account created with `emailVerified: null`
3. Verification token generated and emailed
4. User redirected to verification page
5. **Cannot sign in until email is verified**

### Sign-In Flow
1. User attempts to sign in
2. Credentials validated (email/password)
3. **Email verification status checked**
4. If unverified: Redirect to verification page
5. If verified: Sign-in successful

### Google OAuth Flow
- Google OAuth users are automatically verified
- No additional verification required
- Handled by NextAuth adapter

## Security Considerations

### What This Prevents

1. **Unauthorized Account Access**
   - Users cannot access accounts with unverified emails
   - Prevents account takeover via email enumeration

2. **Fake Email Registration**
   - Ensures users own the email addresses they register with
   - Prevents spam and fake accounts

3. **Account Abandonment**
   - Inactive accounts remain unverified and unusable
   - Reduces database pollution

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Token Expiration**
   - Verification tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Prevents indefinite token validity

2. **Token Hashing**
   - Tokens are hashed before database storage
   - Raw tokens never stored in database

3. **Rate Limiting** (Recommended)
   - Implement rate limiting for verification email requests
   - Prevent email spam and abuse

4. **HTTPS Enforcement** (Production)
   - All verification links should use HTTPS
   - Prevents token interception

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Register New Account**
   ```
   1. Go to /auth/sign-up
   2. Fill registration form
   3. Submit form
   4. Verify redirect to /auth/verify-email
   ```

2. **Attempt Sign-In Before Verification**
   ```
   1. Go to /auth/sign-in
   2. Enter registered email/password
   3. Submit form
   4. Verify redirect to /auth/verify-email?email=...
   ```

3. **Verify Email and Sign-In**
   ```
   1. Check email for verification link
   2. Click verification link
   3. Verify success message
   4. Go to /auth/sign-in
   5. Enter credentials
   6. Verify successful sign-in
   ```

### Test Authentication Page

A test page has been created at `/test-auth` to verify:
- Current session status
- User information including verification status
- Access to protected routes

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors
- Graceful handling of verification errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic redirects to appropriate pages

### Server-Side Errors
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error logging
- Security-conscious error messages (no sensitive data exposure)

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Gmail SMTP Configuration
GMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your-16-character-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"

# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-domain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Configure Gmail App Password
- [ ] Set production environment variables
- [ ] Test email delivery in production
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] Monitor email delivery rates

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Recommended Monitoring
1. **Email Delivery Rates**
   - Track successful/failed email deliveries
   - Monitor bounce rates

2. **Verification Completion Rates**
   - Track how many users complete verification
   - Identify potential UX issues

3. **Failed Sign-In Attempts**
   - Monitor unverified sign-in attempts
   - Detect potential security issues

### Maintenance Tasks
1. **Token Cleanup**
   - Run periodic cleanup of expired tokens
   - Implement via cron job or scheduled function

2. **Email Template Updates**
   - Keep verification emails current
   - Test across different email clients
